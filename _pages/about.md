I'm currently in my third year of the Statistics PhD program at Columbia University, fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Prof. Liam Paninski. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning where I focus on improving neural decoding methods for brain computer interfaces.


I am broadly interested in machine learning and statistics with recent interests in:

- Probabilistic Machine Learning:  Latent variable models, deep generative models, variational inference
- Computational Neuroscience:  Neural decoding, brain-computer interfaces, population neural dynamics}
- Data Valuation: Influence functions for black-box models, time series data valuation}
