  abstract={Mapping of human brain structural connectomes via diffusion MRI offers a unique opportunity to
understand brain structural connectivity and relate it to
various human traits, such as cognition. However, motion
artifacts from head movement during image acquisition
can impact the connectome reconstructions, rendering the
subsequent inference results unreliable. We aim to develop
a generative model to learn low-dimensional representations of structural connectomes that are invariant to motion
artifacts, so that we can link brain networks and human
traits more accurately, and generate motion-adjusted connectomes. We applied the proposed model to data from
the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study
and the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to investigate
how our motion-invariant connectomes facilitate understanding of the brain network and its relationship with
cognition. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
motion-invariant variational auto-encoder (inv-VAE) outperforms its competitors on various aspects. In particular,
motion-adjusted structural connectomes are more strongly
associated with a wide array of cognition-related traits than
other approaches without motion adjustment.},
